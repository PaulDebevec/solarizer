# Solarizer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PaulDebevec/solarizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PaulDebevec/solarizer)

## About
Solarizer is a frontend web application created using a Node.js runtime environment with React and Redux libraries and developed by a team of Turing Module-4 students. Deployment to production at [solarizer.herokuapp.com](http://solarizer.herokuapp.com/) is handled using a continuous integration workflow with Travis-CI.

This application allows for users to configure a hypothetical solar power generation system through a series of forms to predict monthly energy output and utility savings. After configuration, the user is provided data in a table and can choose to view the same datapoints as several types of charts. We hope that having access to this information in a friendly user interface will encourage wider adoption of green energy sources.

## Prerequisites
* Node.js 12.18.1

* The back-end application [solarize-be](https://github.com/PaulDebevec/solarize-be) 

## Setup Local Server
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:PaulDebevec/solarizer.git`
2. Enter the local directory: `cd solarizer`
3. Install package dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run test suite: `npm test` then `a` to run all tests
4. Launch server: `npm start`
5. Visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser

## Walkthrough
 1. Visit the production or localhost application and enter your address and click Begin

## Backend
Solarizer's frontend is supported by two API endpoints: a Python/Flask API combining power generation and utility rate data, and a Rails API serving ecotips and frequently asked questions. The first is hosted at [solarize-be](https://github.com/PaulDebevec/solarize-be), and the second at [solarizer-api](https://github.com/jrsewell400/solarizer-api)
